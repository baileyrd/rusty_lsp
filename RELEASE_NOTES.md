# Release Notes

The story behind each `rusty_lsp` release — what changed, why it mattered, and
what to watch for when upgrading. For the exhaustive, entry-by-entry technical
log, see [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md); this page is the narrative version.

## Unreleased

Closing LSP 3.17 spec-coverage gaps found by a full audit against the
official specification (method/notification coverage was already 100% —
every remaining gap is at the capability-negotiation/type-modeling layer).
Entries accumulate here until the next version bump.

- Servers can now advertise `workspace.workspaceFolders` support
  (`ServerCapabilities.workspace.workspace_folders`), so clients know
  whether to expect `workspace/didChangeWorkspaceFolders` notifications.
- Eleven more capability-option structs (completion, signature help, code
  action, rename, execute-command, code lens, document link, semantic
  tokens, inlay hint, diagnostic, and workspace-symbol) can now advertise
  work-done-progress support, matching the pattern call/type hierarchy
  already had.
- `ClientCapabilities` gains its first typed sub-tree accessor:
  `.workspace()` parses the client's `workspace` capabilities into a real
  Rust struct instead of dotted-path JSON lookups. The raw JSON escape
  hatch stays exactly as it was — this is purely additive.
- Three more typed accessors: `.window()`, `.general()`, and
  `.notebook_document()`, rounding out every non-`textDocument` capability
  group.
- `.text_document()` starts the `textDocument.*` accessor with its
  core, most-probed groups: sync, completion, hover, signature help,
  the go-to-definition family, references, document highlight, and
  document symbol. The rest of `textDocument.*` follows in later work.
- `.text_document()` grows nine more groups: code action, code lens,
  document link, color provider, the formatting family, rename, folding
  range, selection range, and publish-diagnostics.
- `.text_document()` finishes with its last eight groups (call hierarchy,
  semantic tokens, linked-editing range, moniker, type hierarchy, inline
  value, inlay hint, diagnostic) — every `ClientCapabilities.textDocument.*`
  group the spec defines is now a typed field somewhere on this accessor.

## v0.6.2 — Closing the concurrency gap

*2026-07-17*

A performance-only release. A cross-framework benchmark against `tower-lsp`
and `lsp-server` turned up a hard ceiling on concurrent throughput — flat at
around **6,200 req/s** no matter how many requests a client pipelined at
once. This release finds and removes that ceiling.

**What was wrong.** The server's single writer task flushed every outbound
message on its own: one write, one flush, repeat — even when a dozen
responses from concurrently-finishing handlers were already sitting in the
queue ready to go out together. Throughput was bounded by syscall latency,
not by how fast handlers could actually run.

**What changed.**

- The writer now drains everything already queued into one buffer and issues
  a single write + flush for the whole batch. A lone response still goes out
  immediately — nothing gets held back waiting for company.
- The `in_flight` bookkeeping added in 0.6.1 to prevent a race between a
  handler finishing and its own registration now uses a plain lock held
  across the spawn, instead of a channel round-trip — same guarantee, less
  overhead.

**The result**, same benchmark, same machine:

| Pipelining depth | Before | After | tower-lsp |
|---|---|---|---|
| 8 | 5,744 req/s | 24,437 req/s | 31,125 req/s |
| 32 | 6,105 req/s | 60,137 req/s | 76,375 req/s |
| 128 | 6,182 req/s | **84,195 req/s** | 99,775 req/s |

No public API changed. Upgrade unconditionally.

## v0.6.1 — A silent bug, found the hard way

*2026-07-17*

The kind of bug that doesn't announce itself: no panic, no error, no log
line — a request's response just never arrives.

**The setup.** If a handler completes on its very first poll (no genuine
`.await` inside — a cached lookup, a purely computational result), and the
server is under real concurrent load on the multi-threaded runtime, the
handler's task could finish and remove itself from the in-flight table
*before* the spawning thread had finished putting it there in the first
place. Finding nothing to remove, the task concluded a cancellation had
already claimed the request and quietly gave up on sending a response.

**How it was found.** Not from a bug report — from building an honest
cross-framework benchmark. An 8-way concurrent pipelining stress test showed
suspiciously few responses coming back; the race was confirmed independently
outside the crate (a raw Python LSP client, and a standalone Rust driver)
before being traced to this exact line in `spawn_request`.

**The fix.** A structural ordering guarantee — not a statistical
mitigation — so the spawned task cannot touch the in-flight table until the
spawning thread is done registering it.

No public API changes; a pure, unconditional-upgrade bugfix.

## v0.6.0 — The mixin sweep, and going wider

*2026-07-17*

Rounds out the last corners of the protocol surface and grows the project's
own tooling.

**Highlights**

- The remaining `workDone`/`partialResult` progress mixins — signature help,
  code lens, document link, document color, color presentation, inlay hint,
  and the full semantic-tokens family — are typed. Every request that the
  spec allows progress reporting on now supports it.
- `Server::with_shutdown_signal(future)`: wind the server down cleanly from
  ctrl-c or a parent-process watchdog, through the normal teardown path
  rather than a bare process kill.
- A `fuzz/` crate (frame parser, message classifier, `Uri`, `apply_edits`)
  running on a weekly schedule, and Criterion benchmarks for the
  position-math hot paths.
- A failed writer (broken pipe, client stopped reading) now tears the
  connection down immediately instead of quietly serving into a void.

---

## v0.5.0 — Progress tokens everywhere, and TCP

*2026-07-17*

**Highlights**

- Client-supplied progress tokens on `hover`, `completion`, `definition`,
  `foldingRange`, and `selectionRange` are no longer silently dropped —
  `Client::begin_progress_for` now works directly from those handlers.
- Typed file-watcher registration: `FileSystemWatcher`, glob patterns
  (plain or relative), and `Registration::for_watched_files`.
- Position-encoding negotiation between client and server is one call.
- `server::serve_tcp` (behind the `tcp` feature): an accept loop serving one
  backend per connection, for editors that speak LSP over a socket instead
  of stdio.
- A release workflow now tags and publishes a GitHub Release automatically
  whenever the crate version changes on `main`.

**Breaking:** `declaration`/`type_definition`/`implementation` take their
own dedicated param structs instead of sharing `TextDocumentPositionParams`.

---

## v0.4.0 — Notifications get their own lane

*2026-07-17*

The headline change: notifications no longer run inline on the message
loop. A slow `didChange` handler used to delay everything behind it —
`$/cancelRequest`, response delivery, the next request in the queue.

**What changed.** Notifications now run in receipt order on a dedicated
serialized worker. Document state stays consistent (a `didChange` is
guaranteed applied before a later request observes the buffer — enforced
via a completion watermark) but the message loop itself is never blocked
by one. A panicking notification handler is now caught and logged instead
of taking the server down with it.

Also added: `LocationLink` support for the goto family, the full
`TextDocumentSyncOptions` capability shape, `SemanticTokensBuilder` for the
spec's relative token encoding, and ordering/range helpers on `Position`
and `Range`.

**Breaking:** notification concurrency model changed as above;
`ServerCapabilities::text_document_sync` is now `Option<TextDocumentSyncCapability>`.

---

## v0.3.0 — Completion and diagnostics grow up

*2026-07-17*

**Highlights**

- `CompletionItem` fully modelled: label details, tags, snippets, text
  edits (including insert/replace), additional edits, resolve data, and
  LSP 3.17 `itemDefaults`.
- `Diagnostic` gains its rich fields — `tags`, `relatedInformation`,
  `codeDescription`, `data` — completing the diagnostic → quick-fix round
  trip.
- Typed dynamic registration and typed `WorkspaceEdit::document_changes`
  (versioned edits, file creates/renames/deletes, change annotations).
- `text::apply_edits`: atomic, overlap-checked batch edit application.

**Breaking:** `exit` without a prior `shutdown` now makes `serve` return an
error (so a `Result`-returning `main` exits with code 1, per spec); several
public structs gained fields, so literals need `..Default::default()`.

---

## v0.2.0 — Cancellation, concurrency limits, and a real `Uri`

*2026-07-17*

**Highlights**

- Cooperative cancellation: `rusty_lsp::cancel::current()` exposes a token
  tripped by `$/cancelRequest` before the task abort even lands — for work
  an abort can't reach, like a `spawn_blocking` computation.
- `Server::with_max_concurrent_requests` and `Server::with_outbound_queue_limit`
  put real bounds on a misbehaving or overwhelmed client.
- `testing::TestClient`, the in-memory test harness, ships for the first
  time.
- Handler panics are now caught inside the task, instead of racing a
  separate watcher.

**Breaking:** `Uri` becomes a normalizing newtype instead of a bare
`String` alias — differently-spelled equivalents now hash and compare
equal.

## v0.1.1 — Baseline

*The starting point.* JSON-RPC framing and dispatch, the `LanguageServer`
trait with typed handlers for the core protocol, lifecycle enforcement,
abort-based cancellation, the `Client` handle, an optional `Documents`
store, and UTF-8/16/32 position conversion utilities.
